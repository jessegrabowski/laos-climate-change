    r"""
    The linear operator taking a cell-level field to the polygon totals it is observed through.

    .. math::

        y_A = \sum_{i \in A} w_i \lambda_i

    ``units`` fixes the row order, which the model reads by position: it must agree with the order
    the observations arrive in.

    Parameters
    ----------
    units : tuple of str
        Unit labels, in row order.
    rows : ndarray
        Unit index of each contributing cell, one entry per nonzero.
    columns : ndarray
        Cell index of each contributing cell, one entry per nonzero.
    weights : ndarray
        Weight of each contributing cell, one entry per nonzero.
    n_cells : int
        Width of the operator, counting cells that contribute to no unit.
