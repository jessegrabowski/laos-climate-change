    One upstream API a loader queries.

    Carries no filename: an API answers a query rather than serving a file, so nothing lands in the

    :class:`DataSource`, since these endpoints answer a query and refuse a bare request.

    Parameters
    ----------

    license : str
        Terms the data is published under. Some services aggregate publishers under differing terms.
