    """
    Ask Nominatim where one written name is, waiting out the rate limit before returning.

    The wait is here rather than in the caller because it is a condition of using the public
    instance: a loop that forgets it is one that gets the project blocked.

    A name Nominatim has no place for and a name it was never asked about are different answers.
    Only the first is None; a request that failed raises, because recording it as a miss would cache
    a permanent absence that nothing afterwards could tell apart from a real one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        The place as written.
    alpha2 : str, optional
        ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code to confine the search to. Default None, which searches everywhere.
    session : requests.Session, optional
        Session to make the request on, so a crawl reuses one connection. Default None, which makes
        a request of its own.
