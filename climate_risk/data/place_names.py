    Name the GADM units a written place refers to, using its stated container to choose between them.

    Where the prose gives a container, only units it holds at any depth survive — which is what
    separates one ``Pitogo`` from the other without a similarity threshold. A container that names
    nothing, or that holds none of the candidates, is ignored rather than treated as a
    contradiction: the prose routinely names a region GADM does not model.

    A name joined by ``and`` is split only where the whole fails, so ``Newfoundland and Labrador``
    stays one unit while ``Aceh and West Sumatra`` becomes two. Every part that names something is
    kept, except where the name opens with a word placing the event between its parts rather than
    in them.

    ----------
    name : str

    """
    Resolve the places one event names together, letting the unambiguous ones narrow the rest.

    An event's places share a footprint, so a mention that lands on exactly one unit tells the
    ambiguous mentions beside it where to look. Candidates outside everything the event has already
    pinned are dropped, and a mention narrowed to nothing keeps its candidates.

    A place naming nothing takes the unit a point put it in where one is offered. Failing that it
    falls back to the container the prose wrote it in — ``Pesisir Selaten (West Sumatra province)``
    becomes the province, which spans fourteen districts at the median — so the result records
    which of the two it was reached by. A container naming several places, as ``Wayanad district,
    Kerala state`` does, gives the finest of them that resolves. A name one edit from a published one
    is taken only where the container or an unambiguous sibling holds exactly one candidate, and a
    name that only qualifies a unit by direction reaches the whole of it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    places : iterable of tuple
        Each a name as written and the container the prose gave, or None.
    gazetteer : Gazetteer

    located : mapping of str to str, optional
