Getting the data
================

``climate_risk`` ships no data. Every source is fetched into the :doc:`cache directory
<cache-directory>` you name, and most of them are fetched by the library itself the first time
you ask for them. Four are not, because their publishers forbid automated download. Those four are
the wall a new user hits, so they come first.

Sources you must obtain by hand
-------------------------------

Each of these is declared as a :class:`~climate_risk.data.source.ManualSource`. Nothing downloads
them. A loader that needs one and does not find it raises
:class:`NotImplementedError` naming the license, the homepage, and the exact path the file must be
placed at.

Where to obtain each:

- EM-DAT --- https://public.emdat.be/, after registering for an account. Export the full record to
  ``xlsx``.
- GADM --- https://gadm.org/download_world.html, the "Geopackage" download of version 4.1.
- Geo-Disasters --- https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15487667.
- Penn World Table --- https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/, version 10.0.

Rename the download to the filename in the table. The loaders look for that exact name, and PWT in
particular publishes under a version-stamped name that does not match.

Sources that download themselves
--------------------------------

These are declared as :class:`~climate_risk.data.source.DataSource` and fetched on first use by
:func:`~climate_risk.data.fetch.fetch`. No account, no key, nothing to place by hand.

GPCC and GHS-POP are the large ones. GPCC is fetched an archive per decade and a further archive per
month after 2020, and GHS-POP is roughly a gigabyte per epoch. Neither is needed for a country panel
--- GPCC is, GHS-POP is not --- so a cache can stay small if the geospatial models are not being run.

Services queried live
---------------------

Three sources answer a query rather than serving a file, and are declared as
:class:`~climate_risk.data.source.ApiSource`. The response is cached like anything else, so a warm
run does not call them again.

     - OpenStreetMap geocoding, as a fallback when the gazetteer cannot place a name.
     - ODbL 1.0
     - :func:`~climate_risk.data.osm.osm_geocoder`

Nominatim's usage policy caps requests at one per second, and the loader honors it. Geocoding a
country's events for the first time therefore takes as long as it takes.

Shipped with the package
------------------------

One file is redistributed inside the wheel: the IPCC AR6 SYR CSB.2 Figure 1(a) emissions workbook,
read by :func:`~climate_risk.data.ipcc.process_ipcc_scenarios`. It is CC BY 4.0, and it is vendored
because SEDAC, which published it, was decommissioned in June 2025 and no successor serves the file
to an unattended client. Its full attribution is in ``climate_risk/data/vendored/ATTRIBUTION.md``.

Attribution
-----------

The licenses above are the publishers', not this package's. Redistributing anything derived from
EM-DAT, GADM or the GAUL geometries in Geo-Disasters is restricted, and the rest require
attribution. Every source carries its citation string on its declaration --- ``CO2.citation``,
``GADM.citation`` and so on --- so the text to credit is available from the object the loader used.
